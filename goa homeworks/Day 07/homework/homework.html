    <h1>DOGS</h1>
    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. <br> Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.</p>
    <p>The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. </p>
    <p> Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
    <p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes</p>
    <p></p>They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, <br> companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.
